# ES6 Adventure

This code base is a "Gulp-Traceur-Karma" test environment that help test and experience all features of ES6. I use it as the tool during my ES6 learning. 

It is planning to include the following sections: 

- Variables And Paramters [**done**]
	- Block Scoping
	- Destructing
	- Parameters and Spread
- Functional Programing
	- Arrow Functions	
	- Iterators and Generators
- Classes
- Build-in Objects
- Objects in ES6
- Modules

> General structures are mainly based on a Pluralsight Courses of [Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/) - [JavaScript Fundamentals for ES6](https://www.codeschool.com/pluralsight-courses/javascript-fundamentals-for-es6)

I will keep updating the test cases along with my learning.
